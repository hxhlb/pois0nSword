# posi0nSword 
By GenericCoding with a major contribution by @zeroxjf fixing webkit r/w. 

A demonstration of arbitrary read write using cve-2025-43529 on iOS 26.1 

- [x] R/W primatives 

- [x] GC disabling in WIP branch

Most of the code comes from cve-2025-43529 POC by jir4vv1t and the darksword web implementation. (https://github.com/ghh-jb/DarkSword/) 

# Write-up 

This repo utilizes the Darksword scribble method to obtain read/write64 primatives on iOS 26.1 after bootstrapping addrof and fakeobj primatives, and then disables garbage collection (See WIP branch) with write8 after obtaining the heap and VM addresses. 

Darksword *has* a PAC bypass which relies on two things: 
1. offsets for the phone and version.
2. R/W primative from the initial fakeobj and addrof alone.
We currently are missing the offsets, and after obtaining them will be able to sandbox escape using ANGLE-OOB by opening a send / receive port.

Regarding the related ANGLE-OOB bug: The way the OOB referenced in @zeroxjf's analysis repo, *is* related and *is* used in DarkSword, however it is used *after* IPC port which is opened using read / write and offsets, and requires the PAC bypass. Hence why @zeroxjf couldn't verify the OOB fully, without a way of transmitting messages between the OOB and an IPC port; the OOB isn't of use to us at all. 

# Future ideas and invitation for contributions
- [ ] PAC bypass / offsets
- [ ] Angle-OOB sandbox escape
